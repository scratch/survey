== Description ==

The Surveys WordPress plugin lets you add surveys to you blog. You can let the vistors take surveys and see the result from the admin side.

You can see the result of the survey from the admin side - there are two ways to see the data...

__Aggregate__

This will show the results each question by aggregating all the data so far. This will look like a poll result. This mode is useful to make decisions - you can immediately see the most favored answers in each question.

__Individual Responses__

You can also view all the answers provided by one visitor.
